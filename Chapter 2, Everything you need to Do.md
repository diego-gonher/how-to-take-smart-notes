## Questions:
- Why is writing important?
- How should we approach writing notes while learning or working?
- What we need to do to implement this into our workflow

## Why writing is important?

In the process of learning, we recieve information that is quickly processed in our brians. Getting the main idea is relatively easy, as it is not hard to lose track of what we are trying to understand if it is right in front of us without any sort of resistance.

However, to make a lasting impact and get a deeper understanding, writing down what we have learned is very important.

In a way, it seems to me, writing forces us to do a more profound processing of what we are learning. It makes sense. Rather than purely reading and forgetting about something soon after, writing notes is a way to try an actively recollect the main ideas and put them in our own terms.


## How should we do it?

So far, I am understanding that taking notes is something that should be kept simple. Some things to keep in mind are:

- Keep them short and simple. Do not try to overcomplicate them unnecessarily.
- Be selective. Every bit of information has value, but we should focus on just a few of them.
- Do not just copy or quote ideas. Doing that basically skips the step of trying to understand.
